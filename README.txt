- main.py is the main script. I does not takein any parameter to rub

- parameters.py is a file containing all the parameters that are needed for the simulations.
				Edit this file to change things like the network size, the probabiility of an edge forming in an ER graph and so on
				
- functions.py contains all the functions used in main.py

- DataVectors.py contains the dta structures to some of the quantities generated in main.py. In it, the function "create_file"
				creates excel files to store the data vectors.

- The "Deprecated" folder contains deprecated scripts

- The "Outputs" folder is expected to be cleared out at every new run of a simulation, so save the files somewhere else if you want to keep them.
